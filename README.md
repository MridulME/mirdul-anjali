- **🚪 Royal Gate Opening Ceremony**: Interactive royal palace doors with gold latches that part open on tap/click with smooth entrance choreography.
- **🎨 Gond Art & Traditional Motifs**: 100% procedural vector SVG artwork (Tree of Life, Peacocks, Rosettes, Toran, Kalash).
- **🌸 Ambient Falling Petals**: Floating golden marigold petals drifting down the invitation.
- **⏳ Live Countdown Timer**: Animated Gond sun-dial counting down days, hours, minutes, and seconds in real-time.

- **💌 Shareable**: Integrated with the Web Share API and a copy-to-clipboard fallback with toast notifications.
